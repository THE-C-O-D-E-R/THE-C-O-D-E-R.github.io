        In 2015, designers from across Google met in New York City for a week-long design sprint aimed at producing a new logo and branding.
        
        Following the sprint, Google's logo changed dramatically. The company preserved its distinctive blue-red-orange-blue-green-red pattern, but changed the typeface from Catull to the custom schoolbook-inspired Product Sans.
        
        At the same time, Google also rolled out several variations on its logo, including the rainbow "G" that represents the smartphone app and the favicon for Google websites, and a microphone for voice search.
